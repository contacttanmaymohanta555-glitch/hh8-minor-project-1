☁️ Offline Cloud Log Monitoring System






📌 Project Overview

The Offline Cloud Log Monitoring System is a Python-based project that demonstrates how cloud logs from multiple providers (AWS & Azure) can be collected, normalized, and analyzed centrally.

🔹 Instead of using live cloud APIs, this project uses offline JSON log files for academic and demonstration purposes.
🔹 This makes the project easy to run, error-free, and ideal for college submissions and viva.

🎯 Objectives
📊 Understand cloud log monitoring concepts
🔐 Learn how security events are recorded in cloud platforms
🔄 Normalize logs from different cloud providers
🧠 Demonstrate centralized log analysis without real cloud access
🎓 Build a minor project suitable for academic evaluation
